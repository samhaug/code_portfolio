# Portfolio

*Short summaries*

radon\_transform: Removes incoming energy at certain ray parameters and travel
times from an array of stations. Includes a graphical interface to select 
the domain to keep in ray param / traveltime space.

k\_means\_station\_clustering: Subdivides a continental-scale seismic array
into smaller subarrays for regional analysis using a K-means clustering algorithm
to find candidate centroids for the subarrays

doornbos\_ray\_trace: Legacy f77 code with modifications used to predict global seismic traveltimes based on ray parameter. Just for fun :)

deep\_cnn\_retina: Transfer learning on resnet-18 to detect symptoms of diabetic
retinopathy from images of retinas

Linux\_Python\_course: Cirriculum to teach basics of linux and python.

digit\_recognizer: CNN architecture for the mnist handwritten digit classifier.

xh\_src: C libary for processing seismic data. Includes library for beamforming
and vincenty distance calculations.

santander\_transaction: Two neural networks designed to predict 
likelihood of a future transaction given a history of previous transactions

class\_activation\_map: Helps to understand why an image classification 
model makes the predicitons that it does
